## PyPass
PyPass is a Python-based front-end for [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/), 
built using QML.

## Usage
Just start typing. When the password you want to use is displayed at the top, 
hit enter to copy it to your clipboard.

To get the most out of PyPass, set up your system to start it with a global 
hotkey, so you can always quickly access a password when you need it.
