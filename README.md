## PyPass
PyPass is a Python-based front-end for [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/), 
built using QML, heavily inspired by [GoPass](https://github.com/cortex/gopass).

part of PyPass. It is visible because PyPass automatically resizes itself 
based on the amount of content.*

## Usage
Just start typing. When the password you want to use is displayed at the top, 
hit enter to copy it to your clipboard. A small list of pass commands can also 
be executed straight from PyPass.

Of course, you can also select another entry in the list, either with the 
arrow keys or with vim-style Ctrl+K and Ctrl+J bindings. The selected entry is 
highlighted in red.

To get the most out of PyPass, set up your system to start it with a global 
hotkey, so you can always quickly access a password when you need it.
